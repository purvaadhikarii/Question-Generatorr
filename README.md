# Question-Generator
Generating questions by taking image as an input from the user.


System Information: • OS Name: Microsoft Windows 11 Home Single Language • Version: 10.0.22000 Build 22000 • Backend: Python • Model creation: VS Code

I have made numerous changes to the project to make it more advanced, however I am unable to upload the updated project. 
The changes include extracting text from photos and generating questions, such as MCQs and standard questions, based on the user's preferences. 
If anyone wants to know how it works and get the project's zip file, please email me.
